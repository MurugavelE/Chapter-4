# Chapter 4 - Ionic and SCSS

## About this chapter

In this chapter, we are going to take a look at the styling aspects of an Ionic app. By default we have seen that Ionic has 7 shades, or a swatch with predefined colors. In this chapter, we are going to edit those colors, and modify the look and feel of Ionic components. This chapter sets out to give you an understanding of how to work with Ionic SCSS in general, rather than focusing on certain components.

In this chapter, we are going to cover the following topics:
 * SASS versus SCSS
 * Setting up SCSS
 * Working with SCSS variables
 * Working with SCSS mixins
 * Theming a side menu app
